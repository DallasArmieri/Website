    <p>I knew I wanted to do something with dragons. I cam up with the idea to do my pages on how to raise a dragon and have each one focus on a different step. This led me to think of presenting the idea in the form of a scroll as if it was something that was sold to people. I decided to start off with finding a lair in order to be able to show some landscapes. For the second page, I decided to go with hatching the egg. For the third page, I wanted to show off some baby dragon pictures, so I went with raising the hatchling. I decided not to do any grown dragons because I felt I was not good enough at drawing wings to do them justice. All the images here where made by hand except for the scroll background which I got off google because I really liked the image and didn’t wanted to focus on the other images. </p>
