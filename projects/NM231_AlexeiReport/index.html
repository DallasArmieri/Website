    > Alexei Shulgin was born in 1963 in Moscow. His work includes <a href = "https://anthology.rhizome.org/form-art" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #42A58C;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">Form Art</a>, <a href= "http://www.easylife.org/seefree/" target= "_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #42A58C;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">SeeFree®</a>, and 386DX. 386DX is often referred to as the “World’s First Cyberpunk Band”. It has done both concert performances as well as street performances all around the world. 386DX was on tour for 15 years before retiring.<br><br>> Only recently was 386DX brought back into the public eye via a performance in New York.

    <h1 style="font-size: 50px;font-family: VT323; color: #8E8780; text-align: center">How 386DX Works:</h1>
        <p style="color: #ADD354;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">
            
  > 386 DX combines a basic text-to-speech with generated from MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) files to create a weird blend of music. These sound files “contain musical notation rather than recorded sound, allowing for very small file sizes that can be easily downloaded over slow networks” which barely allowed the windows 3.1 to run it and caused glitches and mismatches in synching that gave each performance a unique feel <a href = "https://anthology.rhizome.org/386-dx" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #42A58C;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">(anthology.rhizome.org)</a>.

    <p style="color: #ADD354;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">
        <img align="right" src="shulginimages/386dx2.jpg" alt = "386DX sitting on a wooden palette, underneath a rainbow umbrella. Passersby walk along as he performs." height = "433.5" width = "287px">
   > For the entirety of the 15 years of the tour, the images displayed on the screen of the machine were of a 90s aesthetic. These image choices were deliberate, as in the “concerts”, Alexei had to use a keyboard as a sort of instrument to physically change the images to the music going on around him. <br><br>> The computer was also never upgraded, which lent to the retro feel, especially when, in person, the audio sometimes fell out of sync. When first building the machine, Alexei used the cheapest tech he could get his hands on.

     <h1 style="font-size: 50px;font-family: VT323; color: #8E8780; text-align: center">Why he's doing it:</h1>
    <p style="color: #ADD354;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">
        > 386 DX was inspired by Shulgin’s feeling that the net.art movement was becoming worn out. He felt that net.art was too reliant on the internet and current popular technologies. As a result, he wanted to create something completely new <a href = "http://rhizome.org/editorial/2019/feb/01/386-dx-the-worlds-first-cyberpunk-band/" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #42A58C;font-family: VT323; font-size: 30px">(rhizome.org/editorial)</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        > His goal was to be able to spark public interest in net.art. The use of publicly accessible technology and tools, the cheap components and repeatability of what he's doing, allows for others to continue on a legacy of net.art long after the concert it over. It also brings people together in a new and interesting way using old, tried and true ways.
        <br>
        <br>
        > 386DX tries to expose people to an eerie type of experience that makes you question what is possible with the internet and technology. Currently, 386DX accomplishes this goal even more easily since the retro feel of the technology and music truly highlights what is possible with a little ingenuity, even with old technology.
